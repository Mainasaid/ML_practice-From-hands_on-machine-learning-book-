This project is gotten from the boook:“Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron (O’Reilly). Copyright 2019 Aurélien Géron, 978-1-492-03264-9.”.
It is uploaded here purely for ML, git and github practice purpose. Changes to visualizations, codes or any mistake are from me.
